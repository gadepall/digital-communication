! LaTeX Error: The font size command \normalsize is not defined:
               there is probably something wrong with the class file.

Your command was ignored.

or  <return>  to continue without it.

l.2 \begin{enumerate}[label=\thechapter

The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.

! Missing number, treated as zero.
