\item A laboratory blood test is 99\% effective in detecting a certain disease when it is
in fact, present. However, the test also yields a false positive result for 0.5\% of
the healthy person tested (i.e. if a healthy person is tested, then, with probability
0.005, the test will imply he has the disease). If 0.1 percent of the population
actually has the disease, what is the probability that a person has the disease
given that his test result is positive ?

60\% of the items of output and machine B produced 40\% of the items. Further,

second group wins. Find the probability that the new product introduced was by
