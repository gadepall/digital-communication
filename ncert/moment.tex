\item Two dice are thrown simultaneously. If X denotes the number of sixes, find the
expectation of X.

\item Two numbers are selected at random (without replacement) from the first six
positive integers. Let X denote the larger of the two numbers obtained. Find
E(X).

\item Let X denote the sum of the numbers obtained when two fair dice are rolled.
Find the variance and standard deviation of X.

\item A class has 15 students whose ages are 14, 17, 15, 14, 21, 17, 19, 20, 16, 18, 20,
17, 16, 19 and 20 years. One student is selected in such a manner that each has
the same chance of being chosen and the age X of the selected student is
recorded. What is the probability distribution of the random variable X? Find
mean, variance and standard deviation of X.

\item In a meeting, 70% of the members favour and 30% oppose a certain proposal.
A member is selected at random and we take X = 0 if he opposed, and X = 1 if
he is in favour. Find E(X) and Var (X).\\

\item In a dice game, a player pays a stake of Re 1 for each throw of a die. She receives Rs 5 if the die shows a 3, Rs 2 if the die shows a 1 or 6, and nothing otherwise. What is the player’s expected profit per throw over a long series of throws?.\\

\item Suppose that two cards are drawn at random from a deck of cards. Let X be the
