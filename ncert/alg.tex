	\item A fair coin is tossed four times, and a person win Re 1 for each head and lose Rs 1.50 for each tail that turns up.
From the sample space calculate how many different amounts of money you can have after four tosses and the probability of having each of these amounts.\\

\item Let X represent the difference between the number of heads and the number of
tails obtained when a coin is tossed 6 times. What are possible values of X?
\item A black and a red dice are rolled.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find the conditional probability of obtaining a sum greater than 9, given
that the black die resulted in a 5.
    \item Find the conditional probability of obtaining the sum 8, given that the red die
resulted in a number less than 4.

 \item If each element of a $2\times 2$ determinant is either zero or one. What is the probability that the value of the determinant is positive ? 
 (Assume that the individual entries of the determinant are chosen independently each value being assumed with probability $\frac{1}{2}$) \\
