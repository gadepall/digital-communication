	\item Consider the experiment of throwing a die.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If a multiple of 3 comes up, throw the die again
        \item If any other number comes, toss a coin.
    \end{itemize}
     Find the conditional probability of the event \lq the coin shows a tail\rq, given that \lq at least one die shows a 3\rq.\\
