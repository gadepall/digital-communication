\item A die has its face marked 0,1,1,1,6,6. Two such dice are thrown together and their score is recorded.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item How many different scores are possible ?
	\item What is the probability of getting a total 7 ?

\item Two dice are tossed. Find whether the following two events A and B are independent:\\
A = \{(x,y) : x+y=11\} B = \{(x,y): x $\neq$ 5\}\\
