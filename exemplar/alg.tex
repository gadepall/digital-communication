\begin{enumerate}
\item{7?}
\item{a prime number?}
\item{1?}

\item Two dice are thrown at the same time. Find the probability of getting
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)] same number on both dice.
    \item[(ii)] different numbers on both dice.
\end{enumerate}

\item A die has its face marked 0,1,1,1,6,6. Two such dice are thrown together and their score is recorded.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item How many different scores are possible ?
	\item What is the probability of getting a total 7 ?  
\end{enumerate}

\item For a loaded die, the probabilities of outcomes are given as under:
$\Pr(1) = \Pr(2) = 0.2, \Pr(3) = \Pr(5) = \Pr(6) = 0.1$ and $\Pr(4) = 0.3$
The die is thrown two times. Let A and B be the events, 'same number each time', and
'a total score is 10 or more' ,respectively. Determine whether or not A and B are independent.

\item Three dice are thrown at the sametime. Find the probability of getting three
twoâ€™s, if it is known that the sum of the numbers on the dice was six.

\item Two dice are tossed. Find whether the following two events A and B are independent:\\
A = \{(x,y) : x+y=11\} B = \{(x,y): x $\neq$ 5\}\\
where (x,y) denotes a typical sample point.

\item Find the probability distribution of the maximum of the two scores obtained when a die is thrown twice. Determine also the mean of the distribution.\\
