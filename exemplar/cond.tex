\item A child's game has 8 triangles of which 3 are blue and rest are red, and 10 squares of which 6 are blue and rest are red. One piece is lost at random. Find the probability that it is a
\begin{enumerate}
\item triangle 
\item square 
\item square of blue colour 
\item triangle of red colour

\item At a fete, cards bearing numbers 1 to 1000, one number on a card, are put in a box. Each player selects one card at random and that card is not replaced. If the selected card has a perfect square greater than 500, the player wins a prize. What is the probability that 
\begin{enumerate}
\item the first player wins a prize
\item the second player wins a prize, if the first has won?

\item Without repetition of the numbers, four digit numbers are formed with the numbers 0,2,3,5.The
probability of such a number divisible by 5 is
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\frac{1}{5}$ 
\item $\frac{4}{5}$
\item $\frac{1}{30}$ 
\item $\frac{5}{9}$

\item Suppose you have two coins which appear identical in your pocket. You know
that one is fair and one is 2-headed. If you take one out, toss it and get a head,
what is the probability that it was a fair coin?

\item A bag contains 4 white and 5 black balls. Another bag contains 9 white and 7 black balls. A ball is transferred from the first bag to the second and then a ball is drawn at random from the second bag. Find the probability that the ball drawn is white.

\item A bag contains $(2n + 1)$ coins. It is known that n of these coins have a head on
both sides where as the rest of the coins are fair. A coin is picked up at random
from the bag and is tossed. If the probability that the toss results in a head is $\frac{31}{42}$
, determine the value of $n$.\\
