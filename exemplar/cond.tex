\item At a fete, cards bearing numbers 1 to 1000, one number on a card, are put in a box. Each player selects one card at random and that card is not replaced. If the selected card has a perfect square greater than 500, the player wins a prize. What is the probability that 
\begin{enumerate}
\item the first player wins a prize
\item the second player wins a prize, if the first has won?
