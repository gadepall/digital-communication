\item At a fete, cards bearing numbers 1 to 1000, one number on a card, are put in a box. Each player selects one card at random and that card is not replaced. If the selected card has a perfect square greater than 500, the player wins a prize. What is the probability that 
\begin{enumerate}
\item the first player wins a prize
\item the second player wins a prize, if the first has won?

\item An item is manufactured by three machines A, B and C. Out of the total number of items manufactured during a specified period, $50\%$ are manufactured on A, $30\%$ on B and $20\%$ on C, $2\%$ of the items produced on A and $2\%$ of items produced on B are defective, and $3\%$ of these products produced on C are defective. All the items are stored at one godown. One item is drawn at random and is found to be defective. What is the probability that is was manufactured on machine A?

\item There are two bags, one which contains 3 black balls and 4 white balls while the other contains 4 black balls and 3 white balls. A die is thrown. If it shows up 1 or 3, a ball is taken from the first bag; but it shown up any other number, a ball is taken from the second bag. Find the probability of choosing a black ball.

\item A shopkeeper sells three types of flower seeds A1, A2 and A3. They are sold as a mixture where the proportions are 4:4:2 respectively. The germination rates of the three types of seeds are 0.45, 0.60 and 0.35. Calculate the probability:
\begin{enumerate}
\item of a randomly chosen seed to germinate
\item that it will not germinate given that the seed is of type $A_3$,
\item that it is of the type $A_2$ given that a randomly chosen seed does not germinate.
