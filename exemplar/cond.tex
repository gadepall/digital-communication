\item At a fete, cards bearing numbers 1 to 1000, one number on a card, are put in a box. Each player selects one card at random and that card is not replaced. If the selected card has a perfect square greater than 500, the player wins a prize. What is the probability that 
\begin{enumerate}
\item the first player wins a prize
\item the second player wins a prize, if the first has won?

\item An item is manufactured by three machines A, B and C. Out of the total number of items manufactured during a specified period, $50\%$ are manufactured on A, $30\%$ on B and $20\%$ on C, $2\%$ of the items produced on A and $2\%$ of items produced on B are defective, and $3\%$ of these products produced on C are defective. All the items are stored at one godown. One item is drawn at random and is found to be defective. What is the probability that is was manufactured on machine A?
