	\item A team of medical students doing their internship have to assist during surgeries
at a city hospital. The probabilities of surgeries rated as very-complex, complex,
routine, simple or very-simple are respectively, 0.15, 0.20, 0.31, 0.26, .08. Find
the probabilities that a particular surgery will be rated
\begin{enumerate}
\item complex or very-complex
\item neither very-complex nor very simple
\item routine or complex
\item routine or simple
\end{enumerate}
