	\item  A die is loaded in such a way that each odd number is twice as likely to occur as
each even number. Find $P(G)$, where $G$ is the event that a number greater than
3 occurs on a single roll of the die.

  \item A Lot consists of 48 mobile phones of which 42 are good, 3 have only minor defects and 3 have major defects.Varnika will buy a phone if it is good but the trader will only buy a mobile if it has no major defects. One phone is selected at random from the lot. What is the probability that it is
\begin{enumerate}
	\item acceptable to Varnika?
            \item acceptable to the trader?
\end{enumerate}

 \item A student says that if you throw a die, it will show up 1 or not 1. Therefore, the probability of getting 1 and the probability of getting 'not 1' each is equal to $\frac{1}{2}$. Is this correct? Give reasons.\\

   \item Four candidates A, B, C, D have ap-
plied for the assignment to coach a school cricket
team. If A is twice as likely to be selected as B, and
B and C are given about the same chance of being
selected, while C is twice as likely to be selected
as D, what are the probabilities that
\begin{enumerate}
\item C will be selected?
\item A will not be selected?
